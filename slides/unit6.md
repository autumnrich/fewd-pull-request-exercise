# The Father of Responsive Web Design

> The web's moved beyond the desktop, and it's not looking back. The number of devices we're designing for is growing just as quickly as mobile traffic.

class:

# Flexible Images

```css
img {
	max-width: 100%;
	height: auto;
}
```

### - Images should only ever be as large as their physical width in pixels
### - If nested inside a smaller parent container, then the image should shrink
### - Height will be calculated automatically, will maintain original aspect ratio

name: rwd-media-query
class:

# Media Queries

```css
@media screen and (max-device-width: 480px) {

  /* If the above condition is met, the styles below will be applied */
	p {
		color: blue;
	}
}
```

### - The above media query checks whether the current horizontal screen size .red-text[(max-device-width)] is equal to or less than 480px.
### - If so, the CSS rules defined within the media query will be applied.

# Anatomy of a Media Query

```css
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) and (orientation: landscape) {

  /* ... styles here ... */

}
```

### - media type (all, screen, print, tv, ...)
### - the query itself wrapped in parentheses
### - name of feature
### - corresponding value

## In the W3C specs, every device has a .red-text["display area"] and .red-text["rendering surface."]

## .red-text[display area] = browser viewport = browser window
## .red-text[rendering surface] = entire display = screen

#### `width` = display area width = viewport width
#### `height` = display area height = viewport height
#### `device-width` = rendering surface width = screen width
#### `device-height` = rendering surface height = screen height

name: rwd-mobile-viewport
class:

# Mobile Browser Viewport

### Mobile browsers render pages in a virtual "window" (the viewport). This viewport is usually wider than the physical screen (e.g. .red-text[980px] for mobile Safari).

### That way these browsers don't need to squeeze every page layout into a tiny window, which would break many non-mobile-optimized sites. Users can pan and zoom to see different areas of the page.

# Viewport Meta Tag History

### Mobile Safari introduced the "viewport meta tag" to let web developers control the viewport's size and scale. Many other mobile browsers now support this tag, but it's not part of any web standard.

class:

# Viewport Meta Tag

### - a typical mobile-optimized page contains something like:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

### - `width` property controls the size of the viewport
### - It can be set to a specific number of pixels (e.g. `width=320`) or to `device-width`, which is the width of the screen in CSS pixels at a scale of 100%
### - `initial-scale` controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded

# Mobile First Development Approach

```css
/* Extra small devices (phones, less than 768px) */
/* No media query since this is the default in Bootstrap */

/* Small devices (tablets, 768px and up) */
@media (min-width: 768px) { /* Styles Here */ }

/* Medium devices (desktops, 992px and up) */
@media (min-width: 992px) { /* Styles Here */ }

/* Large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up) */
@media (min-width: 1200) {/* Styles Here */ }
```

### It can be tricky to cram a multi-column layout into a smaller screen space. Instead, itâ€™s better to design for smaller screens _first_, then work upwards to more complex designs.
